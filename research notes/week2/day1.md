## Notes 

DNA is fundamentally a sequence of nucleotides, much like text is a sequence of characters.  
In natural language processing (NLP), text is tokenized so that it can be embedded and processed by models.  
We can apply the same principle to DNA.  

One approach is **k-mers**, which preserve the linear structure of the DNA sequence by breaking it into fixed-length overlapping substrings.  
Another is **byte-pair encoding (BPE)** or related subword methods, which aim to capture broader context and patterns, somewhat like uncovering the "pseudo-meaning" of DNA fragments.
