## Glossary
* Transcription start site (TSS): the specific location on a DNA molecule where RNA polymerase begins transcribing a gene into RNA, marking the beginning of a new RNA molecule.
* TATA Box: a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of genes in eukaryotes and archaea.
* A transcription factor (TF): a protein that regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, controlling when and how genes are turned on or off.
* Motif / TFBS (transcription factor binding site): a short, recurring DNA sequence that transcription factors (TFs) bind to, regulating gene expression.
* GC content: the proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides within a DNA or RNA sequence, expressed as a percentage.
* MPRA: stands for Massively Parallel Reporter Assay. It is a high-throughput experimental technique used to measure the regulatory activity of thousands of DNA sequences or their variants on gene expression.

## What is a motif?
A motif is a short, recurring DNA sequence pattern that is often associated with specific biological functions, such as marking the region near a transcription start site (TSS).
