## Observation

Tweaking the DNA sequence highlights the importance of motifs in shaping promoter activity.  
While motifs are not the only determinants (since factors like spacing, GC content, and chromatin context also matter), they remain a critical driver of transcription initiation.  
This suggests that motif-related terms in the reward function should be strongly weighted, though still balanced against the overall promoter strength predictor to capture biological realism.
