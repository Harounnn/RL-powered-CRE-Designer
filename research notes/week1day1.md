Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are short, non-coding DNA sequences that control when, where, and how much a gene is transcribed. CREs include **promoters**, which are typically located immediately upstream of the transcription start site and help recruit the transcriptional machinery, and **enhancers**, which can act at a distance to boost gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner. Designing and optimizing CREs is important for applications in synthetic biology, biotechnology, and therapeutics because it lets us precisely tune gene expression for a given context.
