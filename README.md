# Agent‑Based Cell‑Type‑Aware Promoter Designer (an RL approach)
## abstract

Cis‑regulatory elements (CREs), including promoters and enhancers—are short, non‑coding DNA regions that orchestrate gene expression by integrating transcription factor binding with chromatin context, often in a cell‑type‑specific manner.

Here, we propose an Agent‑Based Cell‑Type‑Aware Promoter Designer, an RL‑powered generative system that constructs synthetic promoters meeting customizable expression objectives.

By combining sequence modeling, motif‑based regularization, and RL, this tool aims to produce diverse, biologically realistic promoter candidates.
